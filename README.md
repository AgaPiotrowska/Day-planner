# DayPlannerApp

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and was created to organize your daily tasks and mark the pending and fulfilled ones.

## Motivation

I started this project to get some more practice in creating and managing state in React. 

## How to Use

Application opens a simple form where you can type one by one your daily tasks to fulfill. 

Once added to the list, the app gives you an option to mark fulfilled tasks as well or delete at all from your list. 

You can also filter tasks by clicking **All/Completed/Uncompleted**.
